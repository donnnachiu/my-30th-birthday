From picking up trash and making homemade spicy vodka rigatoni to tying sausages together, they've shared countless quirky and unforgettable experiences." },
            { title: "Person 9", text: "Donna joined this person's private dining experience with 30 people, and it was a night she'll never forget. This person is a fantastic host and knows how to plan a party." },
            { title: "Person 10", text: "Donna and this person had countless kickbacks together in college, those intimate house gatherings that were so common on the West Coast. They shared so many deep conversations (and gossips) and their friendship is a testament to the power of genuine connection." },
            { title: "Person 11", text: "Donna's close-knit group of Google friends, her lunchtime confidantes, sharing laughter, gossip, and a genuine sense of belonging." },
